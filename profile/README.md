## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

It is an organisation dedicated to developing the **MeetKunde** project. 

The aim of this project is to create a system that solves geometry tasks at different levels of difficulty and presents solutions step by step.

It consists of two main parts: the **web application**, which is the interface between the task solving system and the user, and the task solving system itself.

The application is written in Angular, TypeScript. It uses konva.js library. It also includes a compiled part written in C++, which implements the mathematical aspects of it. The backend of the application is Django.
Second version of application uses only Angular and JSXGraph library.

The **task solving application** is written in C++. It is a simple server-like application.

An important part of this project is the **scientific part**. Its aim is to develop methods to add 'creativity' to the task-solving system.
