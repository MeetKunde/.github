## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

It is an organisation dedicated to developing the **MeetKunde** project. 

The aim of this project is to create a system that solves geometry tasks at different levels of difficulty and presents solutions step by step.

It consists of two main parts: the **web application**, which is the interface between the task solving system and the user, and the task solving system itself.

The application is written in TypeScript. It also includes a compiled part written in C, which implements the mathematical aspects of it. The backend of the application is Django.

The **task solving application** is written in C++. It is a simple server-like application.

An important part of this project is the **scientific part**. Its aim is to develop methods to add 'creativity' to the task-solving system.
